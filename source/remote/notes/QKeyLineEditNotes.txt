See if a custom widget can be used to view data in a QTableView???
 - Show keyboard icon + keyboard command.
 - Show remote icon + remote command.
The list of assigned commands can be drawn such that they appear as 
distinct commands.

Purpose: Widget provided via delegate to enable one or more input events to be mapped
to a given player command from within a QTableView. An input event is defined as a 
keyboard press or as a WinLIRC remote signal.

Usage: The widget is shown when the cell in the QTableView is edited. In view mode the
given cell shows a concatanated list of the given input event(s) that are mapped to the
associated command. When the cell is editted then it is at this point this given widget
is employed and shown to the user. The widget is composed of three components:

1. Input edit field: This part looks like a normal line edit with a blinking cursor. If
no key is mapped to the given assignment then it appears as blank. Otherwise, the given
input event is shown. Depending on the input source an icon is used to represent a given
type: Keyboard press (keyboard icon), Remote press (remote icon).

2. A push button tool button is shown on the right hand of the widget. When pressed a popup
menu is shown at the location of the tool button giving access to various actions in regards
to the current command shown. Commands include
	- Assign
	- Add
	- Clear

3. When more than one input event is assigned to the given command then left and right
navigation tool buttons are given to allow navigation between the different mapped input
commands.

Consider the sequence of events (i.e. mouse button clicks and keyboard presses in carrying
out the following actions).
	- Given no key assignment, how a key is assigned.
	- Given no key assignment the actions that are allowed or shown in the popup menu
	- Given one key assignment how another key is assigned.
	- Given one key assignment how is it unassigned.
	- Given one key assignment how is the one shown assignment modified.
	- Given more than one key is assigned how is a new key assigned.
	- Given more than one key is assigned how is the shown assignment modified.
	- Given more than one key is assigned how is the one shown.
	
Also consider that key codes can also represent WinLIRC commands and that these mapping need to be shown.
When the key edit box expects input give directional indication to press remote or keyboard button.
