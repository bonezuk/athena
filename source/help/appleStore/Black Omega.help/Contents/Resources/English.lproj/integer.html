			<p>In short, it improves audio playback quality by rendering audio directly to your DAC in its native format without 
			interruption from other applications.</p>
			<p>Natively, in MacOSX each PCM sample is represented internally as a single floating point number from -1 to +1. DAC’s, 
			on the other hand, receive input PCM samples as a whole number integer either as a 16, 24 or 32-bit, depending on the 
			capabilities of your hardware. So before OSX writes the audio to the DAC it must convert samples from floating point 
			representation to the DAC’s native integer format. Ordinarily, for 16-bit tracks the OSX representation is fine, but 
			with 24-bit and higher resolution tracks small but perceptible rounding and quantisation errors into the final rendered 
			audio signal.</p>
			<p>In order to ensure bit-perfect playback for lossless high resolution tracks all samples and audio processing pathways 
			in Black Omega is done using 64-bit double floating point numbers. In addition, all lossy decoding, DSP and resampling is 
			done in 64-bit meaning greater accuracy and even smoother playback of lossy encoded sound tracks.</p>
			<p>When Exclusive Integer Mode is turned on Black Omega bypasses OSX’s CoreAudio layer and writes audio directly to your DAC 
			its native integer format. The player queries the capabilities of your DAC hardware and intelligently selects the best PCM sample 
			format native to it for playback of a given track. Additionally, when converting from 64-bit doubles to native DAC integer samples 
			Black Omega uses special conversion routines ensuring absolute minimum quantisation error.</p>
			<p>Secondly, when Exclusive Integer Mode is turned on Black Omega takes exclusive access of the DAC hardware such that no other 
			application can interrupt and spoil your playback experience.</p>
			<p>Note that not all sound devices can support Exclusive Integer Mode and when not this option is disabled. Also, if for some reason, 
			Black Omega cannot gain exclusive access during playback it will default to using the non-exclusive CoreAudio playback mode to ensure 
			that playback still occurs.</p>
