			<p>The Audio Stream Input/Output (ASIO), as defined by <a href="http://www.steinberg.net">Steinberg</a>
			, is a computer sound card driver protocol 
			for digital audio. Most commonly used by musicians and sound engineer to access external hardware directly, 
			it provides a direct high-speed path to the audio hardware. ASIO bypasses the normal audio path from a user 
			application through layers of intermediary Windows operating system software so that an application connects 
			directory to the sound card hardware.</p>

			<p>In order to provide the best possible sound reproduction Black Omega employs ASIO sound drivers and hence 
			delivers bit perfect audio to your sound hardware.</p>
			
			<p>Sound card providers usually provide ASIO drivers for your hardware as part of their sound driver bundle. If 
			no ASIO drivers can be found on your computer Black Omega will prompt you with a dialog on start-up saying as 
			much. In this case, it is recommended that you ensure you have latest available sound drivers for your hardware 
			installed.</p>

			<p>If no ASIO drivers are available for your computer then you could try installing 
			<a href="http://www.asio4all.com/">ASIO4ALL drivers</a> which works with a large range of sound devices.</p>
