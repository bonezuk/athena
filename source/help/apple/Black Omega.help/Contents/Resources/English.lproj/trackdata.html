			<h1>Track Data and Album Cover</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="summary">
			<p>Black Omega supports a number of different metadata formats used to embed track information within the 
			contents of its file. This information includes name of the track, its album, position within the album, 
			performing artist, composer, genre and album cover. This information is employed to both organise and display 
			track information within the playlist.</p>
			<p>The player understands the following metadata formats</p>
			<ol>
				<li>ID3Tag version 1 and 2.</li>
				<li>iTunes M4A</li>
				<li>Vorbis comments</li>
				<li>Flac comments and CUE sheets.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It also understands when a given audio file is split into multiple tracks.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Flac with Cuesheets representing the contents of a CD it was created from.</li>
				<li>M4B audiobook could contain multiple chapters.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Black Omega is able to support these file formats and creates the appropriate tracks in the playlist.</p>
			<p>Although there are a good number of track metadata editors available it can sometimes prove to be awkward, 
			if not impossible, to embed the album cover image into the associated tracks. Black Omega gets around this 
			limitation or simplifies the need to specifically edit each track by looking for an image file in the same 
			directory as the albumâ€™s audio tracks. If more than one image file exists Black Omega will choose the image 
			file whose name is the most similar to the name of the given album.</p>
