		<div class="summary">
		
			<p>The Windows Audio Session API is a low-level programming interface from Microsoft that allows audio data to be 
			written directly and exclusively to your audio DAC hardware in its native integer format. Developed by Microsoft, in 
			response to ASIO, it provides an alternative way of rendering audio directly to hardware and because not all sound 
			hardware has its own native ASIO drivers.</p>

			<p>When sound is played back via a WasAPI it can operate in one of two modes. Either the sound device can shared or be made exclusive.</p>

			<p>When the Exclusive Mode checkbox, in the Audio Preferences dialog, for the selected sound device is turned off then other 
			applications can also still play sound through the selected device. However the rendered sound, as it has to go through the 
			Windows mixer, may not be written to the DAC using the best possible native integer format or sample rate.</p>

			<p>On the other hand, when the Exclusive Mode checkbox is turned on Black Omega takes exclusive control of the selected sound 
			device during playback. In this mode the player is guaranteed to select the best native integer format and sample rate for the given 
			track that is being played.</p>

			<p>If for some reason, Black Omega cannot gain exclusive access during playback it will default to using the shared playback mode to 
			ensure that playback still occurs.</p>
