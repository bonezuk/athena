			<h3>Apple IR Remote</h3>
			<p>Playback can be controlled through the Apple Remote control. If your Apple computer has support for the Apple Remote control 
			then you'll see &quot;Enable control using Apple IR remote&quot;. Turn this on to allow playback control via Apple IR remote control.</p>
			<p>Note that, unlike WinLIRC remotes, the button assignments for the Apple remote is fixed.</p>

			<h3>Remote via WinLIRC</h3>
			<p>Both <a href="http://winlirc.sourceforge.net/">WinLIRC</a> and <a href="http://www.lirc.org/">LIRC</a> are applications that communicate IR remote signals, received on a computer's IR receiver hardware, 
			into notification messages that are broadcast on its hosted server. Black Omega can connect to this in order to receive these messages, and in turn be controlled using 
			any given IR remote.</p>
			<p>To enable connection to an WinLIRC server turn &quot;WinLIRC Remote&quot; on. Enter the computer host name or IP address along with the assigned port number (default is 8765) 
			where the server is hosted. A message will be displayed showing if you've successfully connected or not.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="instructions">
			<p>To assign a command to a given remote key proceed exactly as in Assigning a key to a command with the exception 
			that you press the button on the remote (as opposed to the keyboard).</p>
